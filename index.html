        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Kyoto has a long and rich history that dates back over a thousand years. In 794, it was established as the imperial capital of Japan, a role it held for over a thousand years until the capital was moved to Edo (present-day Tokyo) in 1868. During this period, Kyoto was the center of political, cultural, and artistic life in Japan, and many of the city's most famous landmarks, such as temples and palaces, were built during this time.

            During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period#:~:text=The%20Edo%20period%20or%20Tokugawa,and%20the%20country's%20regional%20daimyo." target="_blank">Edo period (1603-1868)</a>, Kyoto remained a center of culture and politics, with the shogunate ruling from Edo but the emperor still residing in Kyoto. Despite being sacked by various samurai armies in the late 16th century, the city managed to maintain its cultural heritage, and many of its temples and palaces were rebuilt and renovated during this period. <br><br>
            
            In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Kyoto" target="_blank">late 19th and early 20th centuries</a>, Kyoto underwent a period of modernization, with new roads and buildings being built and traditional structures being demolished. Despite these changes, Kyoto managed to preserve many of its traditional crafts and cultural practices, such as the tea ceremony and traditional forms of dance and music. <br><br>
            
            During World War II, Kyoto was spared from the bombing that devastated many other cities in Japan, and as a result, much of its historical and cultural heritage was preserved. After the war, Kyoto saw a revival of interest in its traditional culture, and many of its landmarks and cultural practices were restored. Today, Kyoto is a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors every year who come to see its historical and cultural landmarks and experience its traditional arts and crafts. <br><br><br> </p>
